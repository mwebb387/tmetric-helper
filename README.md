# tmetric-helper
Helper utility, built using [Deno](https://deno.com/), for calculating totals, etc. from Tmetric

Since TMetric doesn't have the easiest way of reporting how much time you have worked for the week
this utility will calculate the time you have worked, including any active timers, and report:
 - How much time you have left to work (for the week based on the number of hours per day from the config)
 - What time you will be done for the day
